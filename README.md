# Churn-Rates-with-Codeflix
This SQL project calculates the overall churn rates at Codeflix, a streaming video startup, and compares churn rates across different user segments. 

The goal of this project is to provide the company's management team with insights on how the company has performed since its launch. A series of SQL queries were used to compute the numbers of active and canceled users during the months of January, February, and March (2017) in two different user segments. These figures were used to determine the monthly churn rates in each of the user segments. The churn rates at the overall level and at the level of user segments were analyzed.
